# Website-Blocker
I have created a  Python application that runs in the background and blocks a list of websites during any hours according to  user. We will do this with Pythonâ€™s built-in libraries, so no need to install external packages.  So how do you block a website? Every operating system has a hosts file. This hosts file is used to map hostnames (or domains) to IP addresses. This host file is used to restrict access to unwanted websites and domains. Most of the website blockers and parental control apps use this host file for this purpose.
